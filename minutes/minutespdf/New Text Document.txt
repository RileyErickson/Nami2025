this document exitst mainly to ensure git does not delete this folder 
and that when uploading changes made make sure you remove any .pdfs in here that you have
not also added to the db file, since there aren't any minutes you can't just delete
I reccomend removing all other files from this folder if you are running into issues after a fresh pull
Also clear any entrys in the tables minutes/keywords as they might become desynced
